# 2D Platformer Project
This project is a short Unity 2D platformer game created using C#. It combines different scripting elements, design, animations, sound, menus and more to make a fun interactive game that can be played!

## Features
The game consists of 5 main screens:
- The Main Menu (entry point)
- A tutorial level to explain the various enemies in the game
- 3 Levels of varying intensity
Throughout the game, there is a range of different enemies and traps.
There is a pause menu which can be accessed using the 'esc' key. This can be used to control the music and sounf affects, quit the game, or return to main menu!
Directing the player can be done using the left and right arrows or the A and D keys. The enemy can jump with the space bar, and double jump by pressing the space bar twice in succession.
To shoot a fireball from the player, simply click the screen.
You start with three lives and certain enemies/traps deduct from your lives. You can collect hearts throughout the game to recharge!
